Politics and Policy Reporter

Li has covered politics for seven years, with a focus on the impact of different social policies including the American Rescue Plan and the CARES Act. She’s written on the rise of progressive power in the House, the relationship between Democrats and activists, and the intersection of Asian American identity and politics.
