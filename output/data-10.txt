Dylan Matthews
Senior Correspondent and Lead Writer

    Dylan Matthews has since 2018 served as a senior correspondent and head writer for Future Perfect, Vox’s section that tells stories about people and institutions trying to do the most good for the world they can. He is particularly interested in global health and pandemic prevention, anti-poverty efforts in the US and abroad, economic policy and theory, and conflicts about the right way to do philanthropy. 
Dylan joined Vox as one of our first three employees in February 2014, and has been here ever since, writing about everything from furries to foreign aid. In the distant past, he wrote for the Washington Post, the New Republic, The American Prospect, and Slate. He co-hosted The Weeds podcast, and can be reached at dylan.matthews@vox.com and on Twitter at @dylanmatt.
