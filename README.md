# Web-Crawler
A web spider, also known as a web crawler, is a program that systematically browses the internet, following hyperlinks and collecting information from web pages. After collecting the information, it is stored in flat files, allowing for subsequent searches based on string matching. This represents the fundamental implementation of search engines.
